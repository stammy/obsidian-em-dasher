A simple plugin to automatically convert two hyphens (--) into an em dash (—) as you type.

### Usage

Just type two hyphens followed by a space.

### Why?

I never got the hang of typing option+shift+hyphen to generate an em dash. Typing two hyphen is just faster.

Despite LLMs overusing em dashes in responses, I still love the em dash when writing. Its versatility is unbounded—it can provide seamless emphasis without shouting, function as an energetic parenthetical, control rhythm in modern prose, or simply lend visual elegance—a distinctive horizontal flourish.
